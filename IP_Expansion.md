Here's how to use this VBA code:

Open Excel and the workbook containing your IP list.
1. Press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor (Visual Basic for Applications).
In the VBA editor, go to Insert > Module.
2. Copy the entire code from the document above and paste it into the blank module that appears.
IMPORTANT: Configure the Constants:
3. At the top of the code, you'll see a "Configuration" section.
  - Change INPUT_SHEET_NAME to the exact name of the sheet where your IP list is (e.g., "Sheet1", "IP Data", etc.).
  - Change INPUT_COLUMN to the column letter containing the IPs (e.g., "A", "B", etc.).
  - Change START_ROW to the row number where your IP list actually begins. If you have a header in row 1 and data starts in row 2, set this to 2. If data starts in row 1, set it to 1.
  - You can also change OUTPUT_SHEET_NAME if you want a different name for the results sheet.
4. Close the VBA editor (or switch back to Excel).
5. Run the Macro:
  - Press ALT + F8 to open the "Macro" dialog box.
  - Select ExpandIPAddresses from the list.
6. Click Run.

## Macro Results 
Read the IP addresses/ranges from your specified sheet and column.
Create a new sheet (named "ExpandedIPs" by default, or what you configured).
Write all the individual IP addresses into the first column of this new sheet.
It includes basic validation for IP formats and handles single IPs as well as ranges.
It also has a safety check to prevent Excel from freezing if an extremely large range is accidentally entered (like 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255).
